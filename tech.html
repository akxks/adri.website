        <h2>💻 Laptop </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> My main computer is the <i> Macbook Air 2020 </i> it is a beautiful laptop with a good keyboard, nice speakers, nice screen and an okay battery life. It helps me finish my word documents for school, I even coded this website on it, and I usually **sometimes** watch youtube on this machine as well (when I am not working and not being productive). I am considering getting a stronger laptop, to be able to run Virtual Machines and other software, as this Macbook Air cannot handle performance-intensive tasks. I have recently made some modifications to this laptop with this cool thermal CPU mod: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e_JGTbAg2U&t=300s">How to Fix The 2020 MacBook Air's Cooling in Under 10 Minutes
        </a> </p>

        <h2>☎️ Phone </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> My daily driver is the iPhone 13 Mini, it has all the benefits of the latest iPhone, but in a smaller form. Not a lot of people like the mini phones, but I do. I just love the fact that I am able to hold my phone in one hand, and also be able to navigate the screen with one hand. I have been an iPhone user since 2016, and I loved it, my previous iPhone was the iPhone 6S and I have been enjoying the benefits of Apple like privacy and security features as well as FaceTime and iMessage and iCloud. I also had a Google phone (Pixel 3A) before, but switched back to iPhone as I felt it was better for me. However one benefit of Android was the ability to customize it so much, and also run apps like Exagear, where I managed to put Diablo 2 onto my phone and play it (that was so cool!): <a href="https://github.com/akxks/diablo2android"> Diablo 2 on Android using Exagear (with Screenshots of Gameplay)</a></p>

        <br> 

        <h2>🎮 Console </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> While I dont usually like procastinating, a console like PS5 or Xbox Series X can make you forget the world and play a couple games, however I mainly use my Xbox as my living room device to watch TV and watch Twitch, whilst also playing some games on the odd day off where I don't feel like working ( It's bad ) Some games I enjoyed: Forza Horizon, GTA, Cyberpunk2077 and Elden Ring. </p>
            

        <br>
        
        <br> 

        <h2>💻 Watch </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> My watch is the Apple Watch S7, I love it and I just also love the fact that I can wear something that can <i> save my life. </i> I managed to convince my mum to get one too. I just love hearing on the news, how apple watch saves people's lives, and I love the fact that If I fall and for some reason can't get up it will call the ambulance. I also use this watch for other health features such as tracking my heart rate, sharing this health data with my loved ones, and also see important notifications if my phone is not on me. I also just love looking at my watchface and seeing my pet as I set a Photo watchface! </p>
            

        <br>

        <h2>⌨️ Keyboard </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> I love mechanical keyboards, ever since I got the Razer Blackwidow X it has changed my life. I was able to write fast on it and practice my writing skills and improve. In the past I also used this keyboard to play video games like Rainbow Six Siege on my main PC. But this keyboard was great and I loved the RGB and animations that you could customize. The build quality was fantastic, however over the years I have noticed that some of the keycaps kept falling off and the light indicator for Caps lock was broken. I was suprised that Razer was unreliable and failed me a little bit. I am still waiting on seeing what keyboard I can upgrade to. </p>

        <h2>🎧 Listening Tools </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> I have always wanted nice headphones that had noise cancellation and the ones that I found and that my friends have reccomended to me was the Airpods Pro, I bought it and used it for a while and it is actually really good headphones that I reccomend to everyone. They have amazing noise cancellation, and great 360 surround sound audio, and they are one of the best headphones I have ever had, with great sound quality. They have never failed me </p>

        <h1>💻 Some apps and fancy <i> features </i> I use  </h1>
        <p style="font-size:22px;"> Sometimes, It isn't just the hardware and tech that we use, but its about the features and different kinds of apps that we incorporate into our daily lives that can make a huge change, below I have a list of things that can help you become an ultimate productivity nerd. 
        <br>
        
        <br> 

        <h2>😎 Hide my </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">  I always loved what Apple did for privacy and security. One of the new features that Apple has released over the years was <b> Hide my</b>, a feature where you could hide your email address for certain apps and websites, so that they cannot know your real email address. You can get this with your iCloud subscription for you and your family. It is always great to protect yourself online against hackers and malicious actors. </p>
            

        <br>
        
        <br> 

        <h2>🍎 Apple Relay </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> While it is a Beta feature (not yet available fully), It is a great privacy shield -- Apple Relay allows you to route your internet traffic through Apple's servers with an end-to-end encryption, and allows you to change your location to your country location, for you to be able to be more anonymous online, this can, again, protect you agianst hackers and protect your data online. </p>
            

        <br>
        
        <br> 



        <h2>✍️ Notion </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> It is good to have a safe and secure place to write all of your life notes, isn't it? With Notion I am able to process my thoughts and write them down into a digital notebook where I can keep track of it, with a nice timeline and also click through them and always add to it, without wasting paper. Notion is a free to download app that you can get for your phone and laptop to be able to memorise your important notes.  </p>
            

        <br>
        
        <br> 




        <h2>📅 Reminders and Notes </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> This is a simple app on your phone to keep track of to do lists. I use these two frequently to remember what I need to do throughout the weeks, and also store my life goals </p>
            

        <br>
        
        <br> 








        <h2>📈 Cryptowatch </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> It is important to keep track of crypto coins, and the main app i use is cryptowatch, to track the current trends, but I also use Coinmarketccap for more than one crypto.  </p>
            

        <br>
        
        <br> 





        <h2>🌧️ Youtube  </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> When I want to just chill out after a long day, or I want to meditate, I always go to Youtube. There are a bunch of videos on meditation, spirituality and also rain sounds, for when you want to just take a moment and chill out, when I just have a lot of things on my mind, I go to Youtube and put something on, to clear my mind and make me feel refreshed, and continue on with my work afterwards. It is important to have things that help you wind down after a lot of work </p>
