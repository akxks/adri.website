        <h1>📩 About me </h1>
        <p style="font-size:22px;"> As of 2022, I am a Business Student and Copywriter. I love helping people with their businesses and projects, and improving their sales, as well as give insight to them on how to grow these businesses. Read more about my past below. </p>

     <h2>🔨 What I am working on right now </h2>
     <p style="font-size:18px;"> I am a full time student learning Business management and I have hobbies in web development and copywriting.  </a></p>
 
     <p style="font-size:18px;"> I work on numerous different projects for different people, that require copywriting and attention to detail. I am great at bringing attention to things and helping projects become more popular then they were previously. If you are interested in learning more, check out my services on the navigation bar of this website, and also contact me at the bottom. </a></p>
 
     <p style="font-size:18px;"> I work on this website too, to bring you the latest news about me, and my personal development. </a></p>
 
     <p style="font-size:18px;"> I also have other projects in the works, some undisclosed. I also have my Github where I sometimes make repositories and just coding in general for fun. </a></p>

     <h2>🌱 How I got to where I am now </h2>
     <p style="font-size:18px;"> I have been into technology ever since I was 12, I was interested in computers and how they worked, and also wanted to make my own video game servers as I saw people making their own for video games such as 'Minecraft'. I then managed to make this server into a small business and advertised it through social media and server lists on Google, where I received concurrent players and some revenue from the game server, where players paid with real money to my Paypal, for in-game online currency through an automated Paypal API on my game server website.</a></p>

     <p style="font-size:18px;"> I was also into making games for computers, I practiced with Visual Studio and made my own games, which you can find on my github <a href="https://github.com/akxks"> here. </a> <br> <br>For my A-Levels, I studied Computer Science, Information Technology and also Business. I received an A* in my Computer Science coursework where I developed my own Social Media, with fully working friends system, a friends suggestion algorithm, posts algorithm, blog, contact, your own profile and so much more. I also received a Distinction (A) in both Business and Information Technology. I then started thinking about what I want to do in the future, and realised that I wanted to get further into learning Business management and helping others with their own businesses. And now, here I am, learning Business and also copywriting for others. </p>
